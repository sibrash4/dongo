## About Me
Hello! I'm Shaukat Ibrahim, currently an Investment Banking Analyst with a deep interest in finance and banking. My career is complemented by my enthusiasm for networking and mentoring, where I enjoy building valuable connections.

Originally from Bangalore, India, I grew up in a dynamic environment where technology, business, and culture intersected. This background shaped my understanding of business operations and fueled my aspiration to one day run my own company.

In my downtime, I relish exploring the outdoors, engaging in activities like hiking and camping, and absolutely love coffee.

Professionally, I'm excited about progressing in investment banking, particularly in restructuring and M&A advisory. I am driven by the prospect of fostering company growth and the dream of starting my own business in the future.

This website is a fun way to document my thoughts and experiences on random things related to career, finance, and life of a 20 something. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoy writing it!
