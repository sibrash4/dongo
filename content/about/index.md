### About Me

Hey there! I'm Shaukat Ibrahim, an Investment Banking Analyst passionate about finance and the thrill of fostering company growth. Originally from the vibrant city of Bangalore, India, I developed an early appreciation for the intersection of technology, business, and culture.

My journey led me to Furman University, from where I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, with a concentration in Finance. Graduating in May 2024, I'm excited to continue my career in investment banking by diving deeper into the realms of restructuring and M&A advisory.

Beyond the world of finance, I find solace in the great outdoors, indulging in activities like hiking and camping. And let's not forget my profound love for coffee â€“ a constant companion on this adventurous path. I have recently started exploring new hobbies like [insert new hobbies].

While climbing the corporate ladder is undoubtedly a goal, my ultimate dream is to one day start my own business. This website serves as a creative outlet, where I document my thoughts and experiences on career, finance, and the life of a 20-something.

Feel free to join me on this journey, and who knows, maybe we'll grab a coffee (or two) along the way!
