Hello! My name is Shaukat Ibrahim, a dedicated Investment Banking Analyst Intern with a passion for finance and banking. Outside of my professional life, I'm an enthusiastic networker and mentor. I'm also a huge fan of the outdoors, and love to hike and camp.

Looking forward, I am eager to progress in the field of investment banking, specifically aiming for roles in restructuring or M&A advisory.

A personal passion of mine is fostering the growth of companies. I am excited about the prospect of eventually starting my own business.
