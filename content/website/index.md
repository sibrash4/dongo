{{< lead >}}
*noun* | *col·​o·​phon*

**definition:**  
_a colophon: a snippet of history, traditionally nestled at a book's end. it shares the tale of its creation – the paper, printing method, typeface, and the names behind the scenes. more than facts, it's a narrative of craft and context, a whisper from the past._

**example in use:**  
> "in the handscroll's colophon, each owner and visitor added their voice, enriching its story."

**the essence behind my website**

**my personal touch in web development**
this website, my canvas, blends dedication and creativity. built with Hugo, hosted on Netlify, and GitHub Pages as a trusty predecessor. it's a tale of influence and inspiration:

1. the frontend, inspired by the elegant [Congo][1] theme, brings sleek, modern vibes.
2. the backend, powered by [Hugo][2] and hosted on [Netlify][3], marries performance with reliability.
3. my coding journey begins and ends in Visual Studio Code, mercifully guided by [Claude][4], [ChatGPT][5] and Copilot, which reflects the synergy of human creativity and AI efficiency.
4. the project's structure and function draw from many other diverse open-source projects, each adding its unique flavor
5. The only decent graphs and visuals you might see come from [haikei][6] and icons8 

**fonts and typography**

a careful font duo enhances readability and style:

1. **inter** and **inter var**: clean, modern, seamlessly integrated.

**design inspirations**
a fusion of AI and artistry shapes the brand design. key inspirations include:

1. **diverse web inspirations:** drawing from various [remarkable websites][7], particularly matthew perry's [site][8], for a creative-functional blend, including the inspiration for this page
2. **papermod theme influence:** inspired by [papercss][9], it strikes a balance between simplicity and user-friendliness.

while coding in vs code, [css tailwind][10] has been pivotal, enabling awe-inspiring designs even with zero design skills. a blend of tailwind with html is the secret sauce.

content is crafted in markdown in [Ulysses][11], my go-to note-taking app, perfect for markdown enthusiasts.

i'm also fond of [logseq][12], another markdown-based app for notetaking and writing, offering a networked thought process.

**continued evolution**
this website is a living portfolio, evolving with my journey in web development and design. it's a story of growth, creativity, and digital innovation.

stay tuned as this website unravels new chapters of creativity and innovation!
