### website

Welcome to my website â€“ a dynamic and evolving space, shaped by a myriad of open-source projects that have inspired me along the way.

Crafted with care, this site harnesses the robust capabilities of Hugo. The frontend design draws inspiration from the sleek Congo theme, while the backend efficiency is boosted by Netlify's powerful hosting (though GitHub Pages is a viable alternative for similar projects).

My coding journey unfolds in the versatile environment of Visual Studio Code, enhanced by the intelligent guidance of the Copilot assistant. This combination of tools and platforms empowers me to bring my creative visions to life.

*Below are some of the remarkable resources that have played a pivotal role in this endeavor:*

- Hugo Congo Theme: [Explore Here][1]
- Hugo: [Discover More][2]
- Netlify: [Learn About Netlify][3]

- GitHub Pages: [Find Out More][5]
- GitHub Pro: [Check it Out][6] (enhanced with the Student Pack)
